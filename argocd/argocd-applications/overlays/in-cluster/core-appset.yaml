#  ArgoCD is inherently dangerous. Think of it like a grenade. 
#  It has the power to completely wipe out an environment in seconds, 
#  if it's configuration instructs it to do so. This ApplicationSet defines 
#  all of the applications for a given ArgoCD installation. If a 
#  destructive change to this ApplicationSet is made, the results 
#  could be devastating.
